To that end, the MyLNI initiative aims to modernize many aging systems and provide a simplified interface for users to gain access to the many applications where they may need to interact. The tech stack is as broad as it is complex.\n<br /><br />\nMy efforts, as a User Interface developer, were aimed at the Employer Dashboard, wherein users may obtain a quick overview of the state of their claims, accounts, licenses, and inspections. I worked with this team to consume and present numerous data points in a logical, and simplified way. We developed a single page JS application, to this end.\n<br /><br />\nMyLNI Dashboards were released in January, 2016 and serves a user base of ~500k, with upwards of ~30 million monthly visits.",

    "Description": "The <strong>N8 Site Builder</strong> is a bespoke CMS that I worked on between 2012 and 2015. The goal was to build a clean-burning website platform that tailored to the unique needs of ChiroHosting's substantial client load.\n<br /><br />\nWe needed the ability to manage many client websites in a uniform way, with plenty of flexibility and power built into the interface. I developed a substantial UI layer that leveraged AJAX to create and edit profiles and pages, upload media, create blogs, manage users, edit permissions etc; this is a full-featured system, on par with something like Wordpress. \n<br /><br />\nAlthough I was the principle front-end developer on the project, my role extended into everything from early conception and business requirements to engineering platform architectures to performing agile project management. I designed and implemented a system of single-click theme swapping that actually worked. I did layout and design for 6 different themes, each with their own customized set of options.\n<br /><br />\nI also worked with a team of energetic folks to roll this system into production and migrate hundreds of existing clients onto the new platforms. We needed to analyze current business practices and worked hard to streamline the interplay of online systems and human resources. We finally released v1.0 in January of 2015.\n<br /><br />\nThe N8 Site Builder continues to deliver high-quality websites to ChiroHosting's many clients.",
