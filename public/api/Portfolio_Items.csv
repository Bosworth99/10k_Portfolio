K10_01,1,MyLNI,Orca Software,JS Application,,"January, 2015 - May, 2015","Washington State Labor and Industries maintains enterprise-level web systems to manage client accounts of all types. To that end, the MyLNI initiative aims to modernize many aging systems and provide a simplified interface for users to gain access to the many applications where they may need to interact. The tech stack is as broad as it is complex.

My efforts, as a User Interface developer, were aimed at the Employer Dashboard, wherein users may obtain a quick overview of the state of their claims, accounts, licenses, and inspections. I worked with this team to consume and present numerous data points in a logical, and simplified way. We developed a single page JS application, to this end, leveraging various frameworks and libraries, including : Backbone, Marionette, Underscore, jQuery, Gulp, Grunt, .Net, VB, and others. 

MyLNI Dashboards were released in January, 2016 and serves a user base of ~500k, with upwards of ~30 million monthly visits.","JavaScript, HTML, CSS, AJAX, JSON, Backbone, Node/NPM, Grunt, jQuery, Underscore, Requirejs, Visual Studio, Sublime Text, Photoshop, Illustrator, UXPin","K10_01__01,K10_01__02,K10_01__03,K10_01__04,K10_01__05,K10_01__06",MyLNI_thumb.450x450.jpg,secure.lni.wa.gov/home,,
K10_02,1,Secure Message Center,Orca Software,JS Application,,"May, 2015 - Feb, 2016","Washington State Labor and Industries maintains enterprise-level web systems to manage client accounts of all types. Part of this enterprise includes making secure messaging available to many users. This project was intended to upgrade and replace two legacy systems, built to that end. 

As the Lead UI developer, I was tasked with designing an architectural pattern to facilitate the wireframes and designs that had come out of two years of preliminary work. To this end, I worked with another UI dev to develop an implementation of the emerging ""Flux"" pattern, within the context of javascript frameworks like Backbone, Marionette, Require, Node, Gulp and Grunt, among others. 

Secure Message Center was release in February, 2016, and currently serves a user base of ~500k with upwards of ~30 million monthly visits.","Javascript, HTML, CSS, Sass, AJAX, JSON, Backbone, Marionette, Node, NPM, Grunt, Gulp, jQuery, Underscore, Bower, Requirejs, Mocha, Chai, .NET, VB, TFS, Git, SourceTree, Visual Studio, Sublime Text, Atom, Photoshop, Illustrator","K10_02__01,K10_02__02,K10_02__03,K10_02__04,K10_02__05,K10_02__06",SMC_thumb.450x450.jpg,secure.lni.wa.gov/home,https://github.com/Bosworth99/10K_Code_Samples/tree/master/SMC,

Wax_01,1,N8 Site Builder,Waxwing Interactive,"JS Application, CMS",,"Sep, 2012 - Jan, 2015 ","The N8 Site Builder is a bespoke CMS that I worked on between 2012 and 2015. The goal was to build a clean-burning website platform that tailored to the unique needs of ChiroHosting's substantial client load.

We needed the ability to manage many client websites in a uniform way, with plenty of flexibility and power built into the interface. I developed a substantial UI layer that leveraged AJAX to create and edit profiles and pages, upload media, create blogs, manage users, edit permissions etc; this is a full-featured system, on par with something like Wordpress. 

Although I was the principle front-end developer on the project, my role extended into everything from early conception and business requirements to engineering platform architectures to performing agile project management. I designed and implemented a system of single-click theme swapping that actually worked. I did layout and design for 6 different themes, each with their own customized set of options.

I also worked with a team of energetic folks to roll this system into production and migrate hundreds of existing clients onto the new platforms. We needed to analyze current business practices and worked hard to streamline the interplay of online systems and human resources. We finally released v1.0 in January of 2015.

The N8 Site Builder continues to deliver high-quality websites to ChiroHosting's many clients.
